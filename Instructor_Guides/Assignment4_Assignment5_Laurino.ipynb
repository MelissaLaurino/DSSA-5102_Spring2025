    "was a murder that occurred sometime on <b>Jan.15, 2018</b> and that it took place in <b>SQL\n",
    "City</b>. All the clues to this mystery are buried in a huge database, and you need to use\n",
    "SQL to navigate through this network of information. Your first step to solving the mystery is to retrieve the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database. Take a look at the cheatsheet to learn how to do this! From there, you can use your SQL skills to find the murderer.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task for <b>Assignment #4</b> is to:<br>\n",
    "- Connect to the database stored locally using Python.\n",
    "- Explore the database by listing all tables, fields within the tables, and data types.\n",
    "- Find out who the murderer is!<br>\n",
    "- Add detailed comments to explain EVERY query or SQL command you use while we are still learning and practicing. I have my steps outlined, but please add more cells inbetween for additional queries! There is no limit on the number of queries you can use. <br>\n",

    "Your task for <b>Assignment #5</b> is to complete the following objectives:<br> You are a data scientist that was hired by SQL City.<br>\n",
    "- Objective 1: The town is willing to fund more training for officers in SQL City based on the type of crime that is most committed. The training would help them identify the clues that indicate these two types upon arrival on a crime scene. As a data scientist, what crime type would you advise needs more training for officers in SQL city? What crime was committed the most in SQL City within the database date range? Save your query as a dataframe and quickly add a ggplot2 bar graph visual to support your recommendation.<br>\n",
    "- Objective 2: The town has also received more funding to encourage DOUBLE overtime for officers in SQL City during the month with the highest crime rate through out the date range of the database. What month would you advise the town to encourage officer overtime? <br>\n",
    "- Objective 3: To thank the officers for their extra training and overtime, the town will pay for their monthly gym membership. They want to give the officers the membership that the least amount of civilians have to avoid being recognized daily as the town heros. The membership can be used in any town. What membership does the town give them?<br>\n",
